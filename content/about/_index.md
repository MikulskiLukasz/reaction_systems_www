**Reaction systems** are a formal model inspired by the functioning of living cells. This model allows for specifying and analysing computational processes in which reactions operate on sets of molecules.

The behaviour of a reaction system is determined by the interactions of its reactions,
which are based on the mechanisms of facilitation and inhibition.
The formal treatment of reaction systems is qualitative and there is
no direct representation of the number of molecules involved in reactions.
